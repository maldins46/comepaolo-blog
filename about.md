To anyone wandering around here, welcome!

My name is Riccardo Maldini, and this is my personal blog. This is where I’ve decided to collect my thoughts, projects, things I’ve done, and ideas I’ve had; all in the magical form of a blog.

I’m a software engineer, currently based in Milan. I was born and raised in Jesi, a small town in central Italy. I moved to Milan for work — and because I liked the city. Not everyone feels the same, but this is how I see things right now: I’ve met good people, there’s always something to do, and I’m just happy to live in the moment.

If you’ve visited riccardomaldini.it in the past, you might remember that it looked quite different. It was basically a portfolio site, listing my skills, education, and projects. You can still find the old version [on the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250421150702/https://www.riccardomaldini.it/), if you’re curious.

Eventually, I decided to take a different approach. I thought: I have a personal domain — it should be personal. It should be flexible, a space to collect anything about myself that I want to share. The portfolio concept was cool (and modestly, it was a cool portfolio 😊), but it felt limiting. Sure, I could list projects, but without much room to describe them in depth, and I couldn’t really explore topics that weren’t strictly “projects” from an engineering standpoint.

If you’re just looking for a portfolio, you can check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-maldini-a6b684132) or download [my CV here](https://github.com/maldins46/MaldiniCV/releases/latest/download/cv-maldini.pdf) in PDF format.

So I decided to switch to a blog, and here we are!
It’s still a bit empty at the moment, but give me some time to add content. I have plenty of ideas to write about and many old projects I’d love to share. This space feels like the perfect entry point for all of that. Let’s have fun!
