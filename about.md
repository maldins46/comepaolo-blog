To anyone wandering around here, welcome!

My name is **Riccardo Maldini**, and this is my personal blog. This is where I’ve decided to collect my thoughts, projects, things I’ve done, and ideas I’ve had.

I’m a software engineer, currently based in Milan. I was born and raised in Jesi, a small town in central Italy. I moved to Milan for work — and because I liked the city. Not everyone feels the same about Milan, but this is how I see things right now: I’ve met good people, there’s always something to do, and I’m just happy to live in the moment.

If you’ve visited [riccardomaldini.it](https://riccardomaldini.it) in the past, you might remember that it looked quite different. It was basically a **portfolio site**, listing my skills, education, and projects. You can still find the old version [on the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20250421150702/https://www.riccardomaldini.it/).

Eventually, I decided to take a different approach. I thought: I have a personal domain — it should be personal. It should be flexible, a space to collect anything about myself that I want to share, and give the appropriate space to my projects. 

The portfolio concept was cool, but it felt limiting. Sure, I could list projects, but without much room to describe them in depth, and I couldn’t really explore topics that weren’t strictly “projects” from an engineering standpoint. So, here I am 😊

You can still check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccardo-maldini-a6b684132) or download [my CV here](https://github.com/maldins46/MaldiniCV/releases/latest/download/cv-maldini.pdf) in PDF format, of course, if this is what you're seeking!
